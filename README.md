# Functional Programming in JavaScript

A project for learning the basics of functional programming in JavaScript. It takes a small, mostly imperative website and refactors it using practical declarative and functional concepts.

## Functional Programming Topics Covered
- pure functions
- side-effects and
- declarative style

## Objective
The goal is to create a small functional utility library that demonstrates how [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) or [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) functions like `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` really work.
